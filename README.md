## The Algorithm

Add an explanation of the algorithm and how it works. Make sure to include details about how the code works, what it depends on, and any other relevant info. Add images or other descriptions for your project here. 

## Running this project

First you need to open the link to jupyter labs here: http://192.168.86.59:8888/lab/tree/classification/classification_interactive.ipynb
And then you will need to connect your camera(if you have not done the steps to setting up jupyter labs you might need to do that first).
Run all the steps until it shows your camera is on.
Then you can point the camera to any of the cars in the folders and it will tell you what it is!
