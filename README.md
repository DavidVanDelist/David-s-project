# Project Name
In my project you will be able to show a picture of a car to the camera and it will tell you what kind of car it is.

Here are some images to prove that it works.

## The Algorithm

The algorthm detects what different kind of car the picture is. So if you show it a picture of a truck it will tell you its a truck, if you show it a picture of a mustang or camaro it will tell you its a muscle car, if you show it a picture of a supra or a miata it will tell you its a sports car. It does depend on the angle of the camera and if you showing the picture far away or very close to the camera. 

## Running this project

First you need to open the link to jupyter labs here: http://192.168.55.1:8888/lab/tree/classification/classification_interactive.ipynb
And then you will need to connect your camera(if you have not done the steps to setting up jupyter labs you might need to do that first).
Run all the steps until it shows your camera is on.
Then you can point the camera to any cars you find on the internet and it will tell you if its either a muscle car, a truck, or a sports car.


Here is my video explanation, sorry for the bad video quality in advance I dont know why its so bad.
